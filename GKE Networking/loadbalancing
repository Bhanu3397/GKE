Managed instance groups:-
HTTP(S) load balancing:- Layer 7 load balancing(global).

Health checks determine which instances of a load balancer can receive new connections. For HTTP load balancing, the health check probes to your load-balanced instances come from addresses in the ranges 130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16. Your firewall rules must allow these connections.

Cloud CDN content can originate from different types of backends:

Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance groups
Zonal network endpoint groups (NEGs)
Internet network endpoint groups (NEGs), for endpoints that are outside of Google Cloud (also known as custom origins)
Google Cloud Storage buckets

HTTP(S) load balancing supports IPv6 clients in addition to IPv4 clients.
SSL proxy is global and encrypted non HTTP traffic.( SSL proxy load balancing supports IPv6 clients in addition to IPv4 clients.)
TCP proxy is global and non-encrypted HTTP traffic.(TCP proxy load balancing supports IPv6 clients in addition to IPv4 clients.)
Network loab balancing is regional load balancing service. traffic is distributed between regional VMs based on IP:port:protocal
Target pool resource:instances must in the same region. only one health check.

Internal load balancing:- TCP/UDP based load balancer. Only accessed through private IP addresses.
load between regional VMs.

Cloud NAT service to allow these VM instances to receive incoming traffic only through the Cloud NAT, and return traffic from the outbound NAT through the load balancer.
