cloud peering:-Google allows you to establish a direct peering connection between your business network and Google's. With this connection, you'll be able to exchange Internet traffic between your network and Google's at one of Google's broad-reaching edge network locations. Direct peering with Google is done by exchanging BGP routes between Google and the peering entity.

What is the purpose of a Cloud Router and why does that matter?
Cloud Routers implement dynamic VPN that allows topology to be discovered and shared automatically, which reduces manual static route maintenance.

Design Pattern:-
same vpc in multiple zones in same region using same subnet.
Global level:- (Isolation low failure)place resources in multiple zone in same region. use global load balancer.
global load balancer - web tier - internal tier - db.
Cloud VPN (internal load balancer).
Shared vpc with inline security appliance.

Private Instances:-
Private Google access, Cloud NAT.
