What is the relationship between Deployments and ReplicaSets?
A Deployment configures a ReplicaSet controller to create and maintain a specific version of the Pods that the Deployment specifies.
Deployments are good for stateless applications.

Blue-Green Deployment: Where all traffic moved to new versions instantaneously.
Canery Deployment: traffic moved gradually towards new versions
