parallel jobs and single time jobs can be created in k8s.
parallel jobs are specified in spec.parallisim 
parallel jobs are two types one is parallel and parallel job with work queue.

Cronjobs:-
Cron job is a Kubernetes object that creates jobs in repeatable manner to a defined schedule.

Suppose you have a Job in which each Pod performs work drawn from a work queue. How should this Job's manifest be configured?
Specify a parallelism value and leave spec.completions unset

What happens if a node fails while a Job is executing on that node?
Kubernetes will restart the Job on a node that is still running.

CronJobs use the required schedule field, which accepts a time in the Unix standard crontab format. All CronJob times are in UTC:

The first value indicates the minute (between 0 and 59).
The second value indicates the hour (between 0 and 23).
The third value indicates the day of the month (between 1 and 31).
The fourth value indicates the month (between 1 and 12).
The fifth value indicates the day of the week (between 0 and 6).
The schedule field also accepts * and ? as wildcard values. Combining / with ranges specifies that the task should repeat at a regular interval.
In the example, */1 * * * * indicates that the task should repeat every minute of every day of every month.
